Attempt to use ChipScope remotely on a device without a physical JTAG port.  

Device has access to PCI and/or Ethernet.

This project started as a clone from xvcd.
  
  
  
  
Original XVCD Readme:
  This is a daemon that listens to "xilinx_xvc" (xilinx virtual cable) traffic and 
  operates JTAG over GPIOs.
  
  It was written for the NeTV, but the NeTV silvermoon hardware doesn't have the 
  necessary GPIO-to-JTAG connections.
  
  I've chosen the following connections:
  
  TDI - GPIO104  - SPARE_IO1 (J102, test point)
  TDO - GPIO35   - MMC3_ALT_CMD (available on RP116, bottom)
  TCK - GPIO118  - FPGA_CCLK (available between R800 and R801, shared with serial configuration)
  TMS - GPIO36   - MMC3_ALT_CLK (available on RP116, bottom)
  
  You should easily be able to make it support other hardware as well.
  
  The daemon listens on port 2542, and multiplexes between multiple connections.
  
  I've tested Impact FPGA Programming, IDCODE looping, and Chipscope.
  
  Have fun!
